                <b>Anxiety Disorder in Young People</b><br>
                Among study participants (18-24-year-olds) the most common anxiety disorders were agoraphobia and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)
                Women are at increased risk of developing an anxiety disorder
                “Anxiety disorders are not only highly prevalent but are also associated with significant functional impairment, significant reductions in quality of life, lower productivity, and higher rates of comorbidities”

                <b>Music and Preoperative Anxiety: </b><br>
                “post intervention anxiety level of subjects in the Music group decreased by 16% as compared with the pre intervention level, whereas the anxiety level of the Control group did not change significantly. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance performed for the electrodermal activity, blood pressure, heart rate, cortisol, and catecholamine data demonstrated no group difference and no time group interaction (P  not significant). In conclusion, under the conditions of this study, patients who listened to music before surgery reported lower levels of state anxiety.”
                “The type of music administered was selected by the patient.” - effect may be influenced by patient’s music taste

                <b>Music-Color Associations  </b><br>                  
                Abstract: “Experimental evidence demonstrates robust cross-modal matches between music and colors that are mediated by emotional associations. US and Mexican participants chose colors that were most/least consistent with 18 selections of classical orchestral music by Bach, Mozart, and Brahms. In both cultures, faster music in the major mode produced color choices that were more saturated, lighter, and yellower whereas slower, minor music produced the opposite pattern (choices that were desaturated, darker, and bluer). There were strong correlations (0.89 < r < 0.99) between the emotional associations of the music and those of the colors chosen to go with the music, supporting an emotional mediation hypothesis in both cultures. Additional experiments showed similarly robust cross-modal matches from emotionally expressive faces to colors and from music to emotionally expressive faces. These results provide further support that music-to-color associations are mediated by common emotional associations.”
                Study shows that pitch-hue associations were reported. For example, light colors, such as yellow and green were associated with higher-pitched tones. Red and orange were associated with mid-level pitches and darker colors, such as blue and violet were associated with lowest pitches. Additionally, bright, saturated, warm colors (especially on the warmer end of the spectrum - red, yellow, orange) were associated with happiness. Darker, muted versions of these colors were associated sadness and dreariness. Light, cool colors were associated with calm.
                Findings of this research will guide the color scheme and tone of MoodWave
